# Temprature Center

Arduino code for ESP8266 ( board: nodemcu 1.0 (esp-12e module) ) to read and send readings of a Temprature sensor to any device connected to it through a HC-05 bluetooth module.

If the esp received from the Client connected to it "average" which is considered an order to calculate the average value of the last 10 readings and send it. 

This is a part of an IOT project where an Android device connects to the HC-05 module and gets the readings and display it. (using android app called Bluetooth Teminal)
